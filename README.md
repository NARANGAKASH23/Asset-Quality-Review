# Asset-Quality-Review
An Asset Quality Review (AQR) is a systematic assessment conducted by banks or regulatory authorities to evaluate the quality of a bank's assets, particularly its loan portfolio. The primary objectives of an AQR include:

Identifying Non-Performing Assets: Determining the proportion of loans that are not generating income due to borrower defaults or other issues.

Assessing Credit Risk: Analyzing the bank's exposure to credit risk and understanding the factors contributing to asset quality deterioration.

Evaluating Loan Loss Provisions: Ensuring that the bank has adequately set aside reserves to cover potential losses from bad loans.

Compliance with Regulatory Standards: Checking adherence to regulatory requirements regarding asset quality and risk management practices.

Improving Risk Management: Identifying weaknesses in underwriting standards and monitoring practices, leading to recommendations for improvement.

Overall, the AQR aims to provide a clear picture of a bank's financial health and stability by scrutinizing the quality of its assets and ensuring sound risk management practices.
